## Ticket 3: Create Feature List and Prioritize MVP

### Estimated Duration: 1 Day

### 1. **Understand the Problem**

- **Main Problem**: PostWizard must offer a set of core features that provide immediate value to users while keeping the scope manageable for initial release. It's essential to identify the features that are absolutely necessary to deliver a functional minimum viable product (MVP) and distinguish them from features that can be implemented post-launch.

### 2. **Goal**

- **Objective**: Identify and list all the features that PostWizard should have, then prioritize them to define the MVP. The goal is to ensure that essential features are built first, allowing PostWizard to launch with core functionality while leaving room for enhancements in future iterations.

### 3. **Steps**

### 3.1 Brainstorm Features

- **Essential Features** (For MVP):
    - **User Authentication**: Secure login for users to access their accounts.
    - **Post Creation**: Ability to create posts with text, images, and videos.
    - **AI-Driven Caption Generation**: Generate SEO-optimized captions and hashtags using AI.
    - **Post Scheduling**: Schedule posts across multiple social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
    - **Platform-Specific Compliance**: Ensure posts comply with the content policies of different platforms.
    - **Engagement Tracking**: Track basic engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and comments.
    - **User Dashboard**: Provide a centralized view for users to manage their social media accounts.
- **Nice-to-Have Features** (Post-MVP):
    - **Analytics Dashboard**: Advanced analytics with detailed insights on engagement trends, impressions, and post performance.
    - **AI-Driven Trend Suggestions**: Recommend trending topics and hashtags based on platform activity.
    - **Team Collaboration Tools**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on content creation and scheduling.
    - **Customizable Posting Templates**: Pre-built templates for users to quickly design posts.
    - **Integration with More Platforms**: Expanding beyond Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to include platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.
    - **ROI Metrics**: Track return on investment (ROI) based on post performance and engagement.
    - **Multi-Language Support**: AI-driven translation of posts into multiple languages for global reach.

### 3.2 Prioritize Features

- **Must-Have (MVP)**:
    - **User Authentication**: Essential to provide secure access to user accounts.
    - **Post Creation**: Core functionality for users to create and publish social media posts.
    - **AI-Driven Caption Generation**: Key feature to differentiate PostWizard, automating SEO-optimized content creation.
    - **Post Scheduling**: A primary feature to automate the process of posting content across platforms.
    - **Platform-Specific Compliance**: Ensures content adheres to the latest policies on each platform.
    - **Engagement Tracking**: Allows users to track how their content is performing, which is crucial for optimizing future posts.
    - **User Dashboard**: Provides an organized interface for users to manage their posts and view engagement metrics.
- **Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)**:
    - **Analytics Dashboard**: While useful, this can be added later once basic engagement tracking is implemented.
    - **AI-Driven Trend Suggestions**: Can be introduced as an advanced feature after launch.
    - **Team Collaboration Tools**: Could be implemented later for businesses managing social media in teams.
    - **Customizable Posting Templates**: Not essential for the MVP, but adds value for users who require fast content creation.
    - **ROI Metrics**: Can be implemented post-launch to enhance the analytics dashboard.
    - **Integration with More Platforms**: Expanding platform integration will increase value but can be rolled out after the initial MVP.
    - **Multi-Language Support**: Important for international expansion, but not critical for the MVP.
