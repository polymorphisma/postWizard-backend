## Ticket 5: Choose Technology Stack

### Estimated Duration: 1 Day

### 1. **Understand the Problem**

- **Main Problem**: PostWizard requires a reliable, scalable, and efficient technology stack that supports its core functionalities such as multi-platform post scheduling, AI-driven caption generation, and real-time engagement tracking. To meet these needs, the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure technologies must be carefully selected based on performance, scalability, and ease of development.

### 2. **Goal**

- **Objective**: Select the appropriate technologies for the frontend, backend, database, and hosting infrastructure. The chosen stack should not only support current requirements but also provide flexibility to scale as PostWizard grows.

### 3. **Steps**

### 3.1 Evaluate Frontend Technologies

- **Selected Frontend Technology**: **Svelte**
    - **Justification**:
        - **Lightweight and Fast**: Svelte compiles the code during build time rather than running in the browser, making it highly efficient and suitable for building fast, lightweight applications.
        - **Reactive Framework**: Svelte provides built-in reactivity, making it easy to develop dynamic user interfaces for real-time features like post scheduling and engagement tracking.
        - **Simple Learning Curve**: Svelte’s syntax is clean and easy to learn, reducing the time required to onboard developers.
        - **Community Support**: While not as large as React or Angular, Svelte has a growing community and active development, making it a sustainable choice for the long term.
    - **Conclusion**: Svelte is well-suited for PostWizard's frontend due to its performance benefits, especially when handling dynamic user interactions and real-time updates.

### 3.2 Evaluate Backend Technologies

- **Selected Backend Technology**: **FastAPI**
    - **Justification**:
        - **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python-based web frameworks, making it ideal for handling API requests, such as post scheduling, content creation, and real-time analytics.
        - **Asynchronous Capabilities**: FastAPI’s built-in support for asynchronous programming allows for efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously, which is crucial for scalability.
        - **API-First Approach**: FastAPI is designed for building RESTful APIs, making it a great fit for PostWizard's need to integrate with multiple social media platform APIs (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).
        - **Data Validation and Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates API documentation (OpenAPI) and performs data validation, simplifying both development and testing.
    - **Conclusion**: FastAPI’s performance, asynchronous capabilities, and ease of API development make it an ideal backend framework for PostWizard, ensuring scalability and smooth integration with external services.

### 3.3 Database Selection

- **Selected Database**: **PostgreSQL**
    - **Justification**:
        - **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database that supports complex queries and structured data, which is essential for managing user accounts, scheduled posts, and engagement data.
        - **Scalability and Performance**: PostgreSQL handles large datasets efficiently and scales well, making it suitable for PostWizard's growing user base and data needs.
        - **Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL’s ACID-compliant transactions ensure data integrity, which is critical when dealing with user-generated content and analytics.
        - **Support for JSON**: PostgreSQL offers support for unstructured data via JSON fields, providing flexibility for future features like storing social media interaction logs or activity feeds.
    - **Conclusion**: PostgreSQL’s performance, scalability, and support for both structured and unstructured data make it the best fit for PostWizard’s database requirements.

### 3.4 Infrastructure and Hosting

- **Selected Infrastructure**: **Self-Hosted Virtual Machine (VM)**
    - **Justification**:
        - **Full Control**: Hosting PostWizard on your own virtual machine provides full control over the environment, allowing for fine-tuned configuration, customization, and security settings tailored to PostWizard's specific needs.
        - **Cost Efficiency**: Self-hosting on a virtual machine reduces reliance on third-party cloud providers, potentially lowering operational costs in the long run, especially if the infrastructure is well-optimized.
        - **Scalability**: Virtual machines offer scalability options through horizontal scaling, where additional VMs can be deployed as user load increases.
        - **Flexibility**: The self-hosted VM environment can be configured to support Docker, which allows for containerized applications, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).
        - **Security**: By using a self-hosted VM, PostWizard can implement strict access controls, encryption, and security policies, ensuring the protection of sensitive data.
        - **Performance Optimization**: The self-hosted environment allows for specific hardware and software optimizations that may not be possible in shared cloud hosting.
    - **Conclusion**: A self-hosted virtual machine provides PostWizard with the flexibility, control, and scalability required for a growing platform. Combining this with Docker ensures ease of deployment and consistency across environments.

### 4. **Deliverable**: Technology Stack Document

### Project Name: PostWizard – AI-Driven Social Media Management System
