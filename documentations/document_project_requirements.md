## Ticket 4: Document Project Requirements

### Estimated Duration: 1 Day

### 1. **Understand the Problem**

- **Main Problem**: To successfully develop PostWizard, a detailed requirements document is needed to define both the functional features and non-functional system constraints. These requirements will guide the development team, ensuring that all necessary features are included and the system performs efficiently, securely, and at scale.

### 2. **Goal**

- **Objective**: To create a comprehensive project requirements document that includes both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for PostWizard. The functional requirements will define the specific features and behaviors of the system, while the non-functional requirements will outline performance, security, scalability, and usability constraints.

### 3. **Steps**

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

The functional requirements describe how the system will operate and the features it will provide. Each requirement specifies the behavior of PostWizard from the user's perspective.

- **User Authentication**:
    - Users can register and log in to their account securely using email and password.
    - Users can reset their password through an email verification process.
- **Post Creation**:
    - Users can create posts with text, images, and videos.
    - Users can edit posts before publishing or scheduling them.
    - AI will suggest SEO-optimized captions and hashtags during post creation.
- **Post Scheduling**:
    - Users can schedule posts across multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).
    - Users can view and manage scheduled posts in a calendar interface.
    - Users can edit or delete scheduled posts before they go live.
- **AI-Driven Caption Generation**:
    - AI will analyze the post content and suggest platform-specific, SEO-friendly captions and hashtags.
    - Users can manually adjust AI-generated captions and hashtags if needed.
- **Engagement Tracking and Analytics**:
    - Users can track engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and clicks on each post.
    - Users can view analytics for individual posts as well as overall account performance.
- **Platform-Specific Compliance**:
    - The system will ensure that posts adhere to the rules and policies of each social media platform (e.g., character limits, media specifications).
    - Alerts will be provided if content does not meet the platform-specific requirements.
- **User Dashboard**:
    - Users will have access to a centralized dashboard where they can manage multiple social media accounts, view scheduled posts, and track analytics.
    - The dashboard will display performance summaries for each account, including engagement trends and post statistics.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements define the system’s operational constraints, including performance, security, and scalability.

- **Performance**:
    - The system should support at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
    - Response times for key operations (e.g., post creation, scheduling, and engagement tracking) should not exceed 2 seconds.
- **Scalability**:
    - The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle increased user load, especially during high-traffic periods like holidays or marketing campaigns.
    - The system should be designed to accommodate future expansion, including the addition of new social media platforms.
- **Security**:
    - User login should be secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - All data transmitted between the client and server should be encrypted using HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols.
    - User data, including social media account credentials and engagement metrics, must be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.
    - Regular security audits should be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Usability**:
    - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for users with minimal technical expertise.
    - The system should provide help and guidance tools, such as tooltips and user tutorials, to assist users in understanding key features.
    - The user interface should be responsive and accessible across various devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Reliability**:
    - The system should have an uptime of 99.9%, ensuring minimal downtime or service interruptions.
    - Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms should be in place to handle server or database failures.
- **Maintainability**:
    - The system should be modular, allowing for easy updates and feature additions without disrupting the current functionality.
    - The codebase should be well-documented to ensure ease of maintenance and future development.
- **Compliance**:
    - The system should comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) to ensure user privacy and data security.
    - The platform must adhere to any industry standards related to social media management tools.

### 4. **Deliverable**: Project Requirements Document

### Project Name: PostWizard – AI-Driven Social Media Management System

**Deliverable**: A detailed requirements document that outlines both the functional and non-functional aspects of the system. This document will serve as a blueprint for the development team, ensuring that all necessary features are built and that the system performs efficiently, securely, and at scale.

- **Functional Requirements**: Clear descriptions of key features such as user authentication, post creation, AI-driven caption generation, post scheduling, engagement tracking, and platform-specific compliance.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Specifications for performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability, maintainability, and compliance to ensure the system meets quality standards.
